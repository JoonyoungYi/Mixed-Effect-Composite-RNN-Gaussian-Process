Mixed Effect Composite RNN-Gaussian Process: Personalized and Reliable Predictive Models for Healthcare

## Reference Code 
The code depends on the Python package named [GPflow](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow) which implements Gaussian Process models based on tensorflow.

## Reference Paper 
**"Mixed Effect Composite RNN-GP: A Personalized and Reliable Prediction Model for Healthcare"**. Ingyo Chung, Saehoon Kim, Juho Lee, Sung Ju Hwang, and Eunho Yang (https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01551)

## Result  
We conducted experiments on diverse set of disease risk prediction tasks based on medical check-up features. Results shown below show that our model is superior to other baseline models.
